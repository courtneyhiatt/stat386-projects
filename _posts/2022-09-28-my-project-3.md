## What is a linear regression model?

A linear regression model is a powerful tool to analyze data to form predictions and inferences about the world around us. Linear regression works great for a continuous response variable with one or more predictor variables. The general equation for a linear model is: 

### \\[y = \beta_0+\Sigma\beta_iX_i+\epsilon_i\\]


So you have a dataset that you want to run a linear regression model on. Great! Before beginning, you’ll want to check a few things to understand your data better and ensure your inferences and predictions will be accurate and precise. You want to know your results are actually telling you what you think they are telling you.

## Assumptions a linear model makes

First, let’s begin with the assumptions you make when you use a linear regression model. Luckily for us, these assumptions about the data create an easy acronym:

*L*inearity

*I*ndependence

*N*ormality

*E*qual Variance

When all of these assumptions are met, you can be incredibly happy and impressed that your data is so clean and pretty. Then, you can continue with your analysis. Let's talk more about what these assumptions are and how you can check that your data follows them.

### Linearity

This first assumption is easy to remeber. A *linear* regression model requires the relationship between the explanatory variable(s) and the response variable to be *linear*. This means that when you create a scatterplot of your data, you should not see any curves in the dots. You might see a distinct line, or it might look more like a cloud of dots.

Example of non-linear data:

If your data isn't linear, your predictions will be terrible. Your model will draw a line that fits the data the best it can, but you will be missing huge, significant parts of your data by a long shot. Imagine trying to draw a parabola with a line equation - pretty tough, huh? A line through a curve just doesn;t work very well.

### Independence

You want to make sure that your variables are independent from each other, or that one is not highly correlated with another. Most of the time, this can be done just by thinking about it. If I am studying bike rentals throughout the week at a certain bike shop, I can assume that the bike rentals amount of bike rentals on one day does not effect bike rentals on another day. A study about home prices, however, would not be independent. Home prices are heavily correlated within neighborhoods (have you ever heard the phrases "good neighborhood" and "bad neighborhood?"), and this would break our independence assumption. 

If your data is not independent, your predictions and inferences will just be bad. You are almost missing out on additional data to run your analysis. When you can account for independence (using model structures that are beyond the scope of this blog post), you can actually use dependence to your advantage (is this a "good neighborhood" or a "bad neighborhood"? That will affect your prediction of a home price, making it more accurate).

### Normality

Next, you need to make sure your data is normal. Specifically, you need to make sure the residuals (the difference between observed value and predicted value) of your data points are spread normally. For more information on what residuals are and how to find them, you can visit <a href="https://www.displayr.com/learn-what-are-residuals/">this website</a>.

If your data isn't normal, your predictions will be imprecise.

### Equal Variance
