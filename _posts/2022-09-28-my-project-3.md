A linear regression model is a powerful tool to analyze data and use it to form predictions and inferences about the world around us. Linear regression works great for a continuous response variable with one or more predictor variables. The general equation for a linear model is: 

<p align="center"><font size="+2">$y = \beta_0+\Sigma\beta_iX_i+\epsilon_i$</font></p>

So you have a dataset that you want to run a linear regression model on. Great! Before beginning, you’ll want to check a few things to understand your data better and ensure your inferences and predictions will be accurate and precise.

## What assumptions does a linear regression model make?

First, let’s begin with the assumptions we make when we use a linear regression model. Luckily for us, our assumptions create an easy acronym:

Linearity
Independence
Normality
Equal Variance

### Linearity
