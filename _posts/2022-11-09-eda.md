In a <a href="https://courtneyhiatt.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/18/webscrape.html">previous post</a>, I scraped some data from Rate My Professors on three schools I was interested in: BYU-Provo (my own school), BYU-Idaho, and BYU-Hawaii. In this post, I've created several visuals to see how these 3 schools compare in terms of professor ratings and other factors available from my dataset. For my full code for the webscrape and the code used to create these visuals, you can visit <a href="https://github.com/courtneyhiatt/rmpBYU">this repository</a>.
