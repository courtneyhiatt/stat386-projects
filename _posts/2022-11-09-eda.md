In a <a href="https://courtneyhiatt.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/18/webscrape.html">previous post</a>, I scraped some data from Rate My Professors on three schools I was interested in: BYU Provo (my own school), BYU Idaho, and BYU Hawaii. Did I make the right decision (in terms of only professor quality) by coming to BYU Provo? In this post, I've created several visuals to see how these 3 schools compare in terms of professor ratings and other factors available from my dataset. 

I created these visuals using the `seaborn` and `matplotlib` packages. For my full code for the webscrape and the code used to create these visuals, you can visit <a href="https://github.com/courtneyhiatt/rmpBYU">this repository</a>.

Now, let's get visual!

The first plot I created was to see how many ratings each school had.
