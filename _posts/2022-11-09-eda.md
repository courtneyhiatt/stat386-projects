In a <a href="https://courtneyhiatt.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/18/webscrape.html">previous post</a>, I scraped some data from Rate My Professors on three schools I was interested in: BYU Provo (my own school), BYU Idaho, and BYU Hawaii. Did I make the right decision (in terms of only professor quality) by coming to BYU Provo? In this post, I've created several visuals to see how these 3 schools compare in terms of professor ratings and other factors available from my dataset. 

I created these visuals using the `seaborn` and `matplotlib` packages. For my full code for the webscrape and the code used to create these visuals, you can visit <a href="https://github.com/courtneyhiatt/rmpBYU">this repository</a>.

Now, let's get visual!

The first plot I created was to see how many ratings each school had.

Clearly, most professors have fewer than 25 ratings on their pages, but a decent amount have over 100 ratings. My guess is these are professors that teach general ed courses or religion courses. BYU Provo has the most professors with ratings - which could have been inferred by school size.

Next, I created a scatterplot of the overall rating vs. number of ratings.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/courtneyhiatt/stat386-projects/raw/main/assets/eda/scatter.png" alt="" style="width:800px;"/></p>

It is interesting to see how much the variance of the number of ratings increases as the overall rating increases. It seems that students are maybe less willing to write a review for really bad professors than really good ones, which surprised me; I thought students would be excited to rant about professors rather than rave.

For my next plot, I decided to subset the data by department. Since there were over 200 unique departments in the dataset, I only included those in my own college (Physical and Mathematical Sciences). Here is a boxplot showing overall ratings by department.

It seems that if you want to guarantee your professor will not be terrible, you should major in math education, since none of the overall ratings were below a 3.0. Statistics and Computer Science both have a full range of overall ratings - you could expect to run into at least one 1.0 professor and one 5.0 professor in your time. It is also interesting to note that mathematics has the highest median.

I wanted to see how my three schools compared in same boxplot setup as the above graphic, so I grouped by school and created another one.

So, if you want to major in statistics or math ed, BYU Provo is your only option. It looks like Hawaii's physics department is abyssmal, so avoid going there if physics is on your radar. Idaho has the highest ratings for their mathematics professors, so maybe they have multivariate calculus and linear algebra figured out a little bit better up there. Hawaii has the best chemistry professors, but maybe they just don't have a course that's as brutal as CHEM 105 at BYU Provo.

Next, I wanted to see if there was any correlation between a professor having a middle name listed and their overall rating.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/courtneyhiatt/stat386-projects/raw/main/assets/eda/middlenamebyschool.png" alt="" style="width:800px;"/></p>

The answer: maybe? These two groups have vastly different sample sizes (most professors don't have middle names), so it's hard to get an accurate picture from a simple boxplot. Further analysis and modeling would be needed to determine any real correlation between having a middle name and overall rating.

Next, I just wanted to see which how the professors overall ratings compared by school.
