In a <a href="https://courtneyhiatt.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/18/webscrape.html">previous post</a>, I scraped some data from Rate My Professors on three schools I was interested in: BYU Provo (my own school), BYU Idaho, and BYU Hawaii. Did I make the right decision (in terms of only professor quality) by coming to BYU Provo? In this post, I've created several visuals to see how these 3 schools compare in terms of professor ratings and other factors available from my dataset. 

I created these visuals using the `seaborn` and `matplotlib` packages. For my full code for the webscrape and the code used to create these visuals, you can visit <a href="https://github.com/courtneyhiatt/rmpBYU">this repository</a>.

Now, let's get visual!

The first plot I created was to see how many ratings each school had.

Clearly, most professors have fewer than 25 ratings on their pages, but a decent amount have over 100 ratings. My guess is these are professors that teach general ed courses or religion courses. BYU Provo has the most professors with ratings - which could have been inferred by school size.

Next, I created a scatterplot of the overall rating vs. number of ratings.

It is interesting to see how much the variance of the number of ratings increases as the overall rating increases. It seems that students are maybe less willing to write a review for really bad professors than really good ones, which surprised me; I thought students would be excited to rant about professors rather than rave.

For my next plot, I decided to subset the data by department. Since there were over 200 unique departments in the dataset, I only included those in my own college (Physical and Mathematical Sciences). Here is a boxplot showing overall ratings by department.
